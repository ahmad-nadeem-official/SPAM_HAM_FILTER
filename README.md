## **📂 Installation Instructions:**

Getting this project running is easy, and here's how you do it in **three simple steps**!

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-filter.git

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required dependencies using pip.
   '''bash
   cd spam-email-filter
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the Spam Email Filter by running the ui.py script.
   '''bash
   python ui.py


## 💻 Usage Instructions:

1. **Start the Application**:  
   Open the GUI by running the `ui.py` script.

2. **Enter Email Details**:  
   Simply enter the **Subject** and **Email Content** of the email you'd like to classify.

3. **Click "Check Spam"**:  
   Hit the button to instantly check whether your email is **Spam** or **Ham**.

4. **Get Instant Results**:  
   The result will be displayed immediately below, either as **Spam** or **Ham**.


## 💡 How It Works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   Emails are preprocessed and cleaned using **Pandas**, removing unnecessary columns and noise for better model training.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:  
   The text data (**email subject** and **content**) is transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF**, making sure important words are emphasized for classification.

3. **Model Training**:  
   A **BaggingClassifier** is trained on a labeled dataset of emails to accurately detect **spam** with high performance.

4. **Real-Time Prediction**:  
   Once trained, the model classifies new emails in **real-time**, giving instant results on whether they are **Spam** or **Ham**.
